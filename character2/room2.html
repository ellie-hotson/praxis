            The Desk: You may be wondering why there is a desk in his bedroom. David lives in a 2 bedroom flat, where one of his rooms is his son Jacks. David often works from home and his living room area is very small which leaves him no choice but to have a desk in his bedroom.

                Desk Clutter: Desk Clutter: Every desk is not complete without desk clutter. but you could actually argue that they are also desk essentials. He has his laptop and headphones on the desk definitely essential, but also pens, a hole punch, desk light all things you would expect to see on a desk.

                Toys: It is not only books that Jack leaves lying around in Davids bedroom. He also leaves his toys, sometimes he like to play in his Dads room, especially when David is working at his desk. There are toys dotted around the room when Jack has got bored and left them there. There are also intentional toys on his desk where Jack has given them to David as a gift, for example he has given him a car or a soft toy or made him a drink from his play kitchen. The toys in Davids room are just a selection of ones that Jack has left there as Jack has his own room in Davids flat filled with toys.
